    "# Using `refnx` on a cluster with MPI\n",
    "\n",
    "`refnx` can be used on a compute cluster, typically when you want to do a largish MCMC sampling run. You will need to install these packages in the Python environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- refnx\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "- cython\n",
    "- schwimmbad\n",
    "- mpi4py\n",
    "- scipy\n",
    "\n",
    "For this specific example you'll also need the `corner` and `matplotlib` packages. Setting up a Python environment on your cluster can have difficulties, so contact your helpful cluster administrator if you need help.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would typically start the code running with something along the lines of:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mpiexec -n 8 python cf.py       # requests parallelisation over 8 processes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(assuming the script is saved as `cf.py`). This call might be started using a scheduler, such as PBS. Use of that is outside the bounds of this tutorial. Again, your cluster admin would be able to help there.\n",
    "This file would generate a text file called `steps.chain` which would then be further processed to give an output that's useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start modifying this example for your purposes you should begin by tailoring the `setup` function to return an `refnx.analysis.Objective` for your system."
